  "I am a driven young professional living in Brooklyn. I am originally from the New Jersey Shore, and I went to college at Fordham University. After spending some time working in finance, I decided to make a change. I started looking into coding, and immediately wanted to learn everything. I am really excited to start building websites, software, applications, and learning as much as I can"
